Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) Zoomcamp
This repository is dedicated to the Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) Zoomcamp , a hands-on course offered by DataTalks.Club . The course focuses on bridging the gap between machine learning development and production by teaching best practices for deploying, monitoring, and managing ML models in real-world environments.

What is MLOps?
MLOps, or Machine Learning Operations , is a set of practices that combines machine learning, DevOps, and data engineering to streamline the lifecycle of machine learning models. It ensures that models are not only developed effectively but also deployed, monitored, and updated efficiently in production environments. MLOps helps organizations scale their ML efforts while maintaining reliability, reproducibility, and performance.
